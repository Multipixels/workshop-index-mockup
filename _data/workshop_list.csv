What are ORCiDs and DOIs--and Why Do I Need Them?,"Instructors: Jeff Demaine (Bibliometrics and Research Impact Librarian) and Danica Evering (Research Data Management Specialist)

We’ve all seen a 404-error message, trying to access an old hyperlink. Link rot happens when a site is removed or a URL stops pointing to the right location. Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are reference links that can never rot and are increasingly important in an interconnected research world!

While some fields and researchers have actively incorporated PIDs for many years now, others rely on interpersonal networks and personal websites to connect their research. This workshop will give you skills to augment those important connections with PIDs.

Some might have received a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for an article published in a journal, but they can also be used to share data (field notes, methods, audio recordings, code), connected to a website, or associated with an artwork. An Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCiD) is a unique link where you can connect to all your expansive scholarly output—datasets, articles, exhibitions, projects, interviews, education, residencies, and more.

Used together, PIDs can help you find new collaborators across disciplines, recognize the breadth of your work beyond journals, and allow you to connect to your research practice over time.",February 2023,https://scds.github.io/intro-rdm/doi-orcid.html,ORCiD,open access; RDM; research impact,RDM

Qualitative research data can take the form of interview transcripts, oral histories, focus groups, field notes, audio, video, and more. Some qualitative researchers are accustomed to research data management (RDM) and data sharing, while others are less familiar. This workshop welcomes both groups to learn about best practices and considerations for managing and sharing quantitative data. We’ll start with practical skills and workflows, and then move on to a discussion about hesitations and urgencies. Qualitative research often grows out of relationships of trust, and information is deeply contextual, making data sharing sticky. However, communities are often approached by different researchers for similar information, and data sharing can also help alleviate research fatigue.

Everything on Paper Will be Used Against Me: Quantifying Kissinger,"Scarcity of information is a common frustration for historians. For students of twentieth- and twenty-first century history, however, the opposite problem is also increasingly common — overwhelmed by a deluge of information and confronted by a vast field of haystacks within which they must locate the needles, historians of the modern era have begun to struggle with what is now understood as ‘big data’. The declassification of the Kissinger material by the State Department and the hosting of more than 50,000 pages of that material on the Digital National Security Archive (DNSA)’s Kissinger Collection web site present just such a ‘big data’ opportunity for historians. While having this large volume of information online for researchers is valuable, the restriction to a web-based ‘search’ interface can render it of limited use to researchers. In her presentation, Micki Kaufman will detail the application of a number of quantitative text analysis methods like word frequency/correlation, topic modeling and sentiment analysis in conjunction with a plethora of data visualization techniques to a study of the DNSA’s Kissinger Collections, comprising approximately 18,000 meeting memoranda (‘memcons’) and teleconference transcripts (‘telcons’) detailing the former US National Security Advisor and Secretary of State’s correspondence during the period 1969-1977.

Micki Kaufman (MA CUNY, BA Columbia) is Director of Information Systems at the MLA and a fifth-year doctoral student in US History at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York (GC-CUNY). At the MLA Micki is responsible for oversight of the association’s technical vision and strategy in its mission to support humanities scholars and scholarship.

"‘But first, let me take a #selfie’: Photographic self-representation in social media","Aimée Morrison, University of Waterloo
In The Chainsmokers’ 2014 novelty hit song, “#Selfie,” a valley girl vocal-fries and uptalks her way through a stream of consciousness vocal track, narration swirling around a centre of Instagram likes, casual hookups, and public drunkenness, all captured and shared on social media. Like “Valley Girl” in the 1980s, “#Selfie” codifies and crystallizes a cultural moment and a set of in-group behaviours and language, to both celebrate and condemn simultaneously. But this kind of disavowal and dismissal misses the point: selfies are ubiquitous across contemporary digital culture. No matter how much everyone seems to hate them, everyone also seems to be taking them. The urge to have a photographic representation of oneself is of course not new. Photographic portraits have existed since the dawn of photography; self-portraits followed soon after. As long as there has been photography, there have been images of people, commissioned by the subjects themselves at first, but soon enough taken by themselves as well. But the “selfie,” as practiced in online social media, is something new even if it’s not rare, a conjunction of technology, social practice, aesthetics, and sharing platforms. This talk considers the selfie as a form of digital life writing, using rhetorical genre, new media studies, and autobiography to tease out the multiple layers of meaning in each bathroom mirror bicep pop.

Aimée Morrison is Associate Professor and Associate Chair for Graduate Studies in the Department of English at the University of Waterloo. She has been considering and writing on the intersection of life writing and digital media since 2008, and has also published on topics as varied as internet democracy and 80s movies about video games. She is surprised to be writing a book about selfies. She is a co-founder of the popular feminist academic blog Hook and Eye. Twitter: @digiwonk.",February 2017,NA,,Social Media; DH,Research Series
Studying the Infinite Archive: The Web as a Historical Resource,"Born-digital historical sources have the potential to reshape the humanities and social sciences. The sheer volume of cultural information generated and, crucially, preserved every day presents exciting opportunities for historians, political scientists, sociologists, and other scholars. Much of this information is captured within web archives containing billions of URLs, including individual homepages, social media sites and feeds, institutional pages, and corporate sites. This material introduces important new avenues of research for historians working in diverse fields. For example, historians broaching topics dating back to the mid-1990s will find their projects enriched by this web data: social historians can explore aspects of everyday life through blogs, homepages, comments, and guestbooks; and economic historians can explore commercial activity online. Other fields, from political science to sociology, can also benefit from working with this data at scale. In short, these web archives make possible reconstruction of large-scale traces of the recent past.

These opportunities are counterbalanced by challenges: of scale, technical difficulty, and of needing to form collaborative networks. At the University of Waterloo and York University, our Web Archives for Historical Research group accordingly joins historians, librarians, and computer scientists. We explore how historians can use web archives, the assemblage of cultural information that various organizations have been collecting since 1996, now providing an invaluable amount of information about the previous twenty years. In blogs, personal websites, corporate homepages, and beyond – our own datasets are over 20 TB in size, from 1990s homepages in GeoCities to political party websites from the 2000s – we have the building blocks of historical narratives. Accessing collections on this scale requires specialized computational knowledge and infrastructure.

My talk reflects on these challenges. It introduces the problem of born-digital abundance, and then goes into specific case studies to show how we have attempted to make sense of all of this data: from the warcbase web analytics platform, the Archives Unleashed series of datathons, and the Web Archives for Longitudinal Knowledge project. Our goal is to let all scholars and the general public have access to all of this cultural heritage we have been collecting as a culture since 1996.

"Co-creation in Place: Participation, Energy, and the (un)Settled Politics of Work","Maria Michails works across disciplines in the arts, engineering, science and social sciences to produce projects that draw on scientific ideas and emerging technologies. She is interested in developing diverse modes of participation for the co-production of knowledge-making tools that could re-imagine civic engagement with environmental issues. Taking consumer behaviour, labour, and ecological crisis as the entry points of inquiry, her gallery-based works have recently spawned a new direction toward a critically-engaged eco-social practice, where her focus has shifted to engaging communities in co-creative processes to tackle localized environmental problems. Her current (PhD) research centers on methods that integrate citizen science, critical-making, and ethnography – embedding oral histories with interactive mapping, environmental sensing and performance, as tactics for knowledge-production and sleuthing activism to affect policy decision-making. Addressing these themes, concerns and methodologies, Michails will discuss several works including S.OIL, a human-powered installation that communicates the connection between energy and food production; AirTRACS an art-science community air quality sensing project created with youth in an environmental justice community; and a new archiving and documentation project titled The Orphans with Saskatchewan farmers who are left with abandoned oil wells without much recourse for cleanup.

"Radical Transparency, Representing the Material Digitally, and the Database as a Methodological Model","Matthew Evan Davis, Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship

Traditionally, databases have been seen as a repository for scholarship—a place to store information for later retrieval. This only taps into part of the potential of the potential of databases, however. Carefully constructed and articulated databases serve not only to store information, but are an aid to critical thinking that identify points of tension, clarify what seems muddled, and allow the examination of textual cruces. Moreover, thinking about the database in terms beyond the repository belies a falsehood that has become a societal truism: that data is itself objective.

Popularly thought to be free of bias and thus a window to objective “truth,” this bias can be seen in phrases like “the wisdom of crowds.” In reality, however, the “thing”-ness of the material object is never completely captured, understood, or explained. A version of that thing, mediated by the tools, ideas, and experiences of both the researcher and viewer is instead inscribed and read from whatever medium is used. By putting such moments of mediation foremost in the mind of the scholar, databases serve to prevent the text reverting into a black box, receiving input and generating output, but in a way that cannot be understood or articulated.

Beginning with an examination of Davis’ work with medieval and early Tudor written and performed texts—specifically the Chantry chapel at Holy Trinity, Long Melford, the parish registers “Baldwyne” and “Herveye,” and the fifteenth-century poems of John Lydgate—this first part of a two-part talk will explore what the process of mediation the database brings to the relationship between these works reveals for larger questions surrounding the role of the laity in late medieval and early Tudor religious culture.",January 2018,NA,,DH; digital humanities; databases,Research Series
Hot Tips To Boost Your Interdisciplinary Web Archive Collaboration!,"Nick Ruest, York University

Web archives are intimidating. You’re dealing with size and scale issues, wild formats from the live web, and just a massive amount of information to sift through. But, we can’t hide our heads in the sand, and ignore it. This is our cultural heritage, and we need to make sense of it. You definitely don’t want to tackle this alone, and the good news is that has been a lot of work done already, and there are a lot of great people working here. Nick Ruest will discuss the research and tools he is working on with an interdisciplinary team of collaborators from fields as varied as history, political science, sociology, and computer science to help make sense of it all.

Nick Ruest is the Digital Assets Librarian at York University, co-Principal Investigator of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funded The Archives Unleashed Project, co-Principal Investigator of the SSHRC grant “A Longitudinal Analysis of the Canadian World Wide Web as a Historical Resource, 1996-2014”, and co-Principal Investigator of the Compute Canada Research Platforms and Portals Web Archives for Longitudinal Knowledge.

At York University, he oversees the development of data curation, asset management and preservation initiatives, along with creating and implementing systems that support the capture, description, delivery, and preservation of digital objects having significant content of enduring value.

"3D Printing & Open Innovation: Intellectual Property, the Creative Commons & the New Economy","This presentation will consider 3D printing in terms of intellectual property, the Creative Commons, and the New Economy. It will explore the use of open licensing in the context of the maker movement, 3D printing and additive manufacturing. The traditional historical categories of intellectual property have been disrupted by the cross-cutting technologies and cultural practices of the Maker Movement. There have been conflicts and skirmishes over copyright law and 3D printing – such as in the dispute over Katy Perry and Left Shark. 3D printing has also raised issues about the operation of copyright exceptions, intermediary liability, and technological protection measures. 3D printing firms have been anxious about the impact of the Supreme Court of the United States decision in Star Athletica about the relationship between the public domain, copyright law, and designs law. The topic of 3D printing and the right of repair has been significant in a number of areas of intellectual property (including designs law). Trademark holders have explored partnerships and collaborations with 3D printing companies – as well as enforcement actions. In patent law, 3D printing raises issues about patentable subject matter, patent infringement, and patent exceptions – particularly the defence of experimental use. The dispute between Desktop Metal Inc. and Markforged Inc. over patent law, trade secrets, and contract law in metal 3D printing is an important case study. There has been a tension between the proprietary approaches of start-up companies (particularly in respect of trade secrets), and the open ethos of the maker movement. One of the key features of the State of the Commons Report 2016 was the increasing use of creative commons licenses in the context of 3D printing. There has been much discussion about 3D printing in terms of open licensing, open education, open data, and open innovation.",April 2020,NA,,3D printing; open access,Research Series

Walking the Talk: Editing Wikipedia with Purpose (Cancelled),"Started nineteen years ago Wikipedia is one of the most visited websites on the Internet, but it’s popularity is not without issue. Editors are predominantly males from the global north which has led to documented systemic bias and a chronic underrepresentation of pages related to equity seeking communities. Drawing on her experience editing Wikipedia through an archival lens, Danielle Robichaudwill challenge the assumption that anyone being able to edit Wikipedia makes it a dubious information resource by positioning the site’s openness as an opportunity to put stated commitments to equity, inclusion, diversity and reconciliation into action through purposeful editing.

Equity Driven Open Science Policies in Biomedical Research: A New Model for Drug Discovery in Rare Diseases?,"Dr. Rachel Harding (Huntington's Disease Society of America Career Development Fellow, Utoronto). Drug discovery too often focuses on the bottom line rather than on the people who the development of new medicines might benefit, or other stakeholders in the research process. Self-serving and conservative approaches to biomedical research have left an innovation gap, so many disease communities have unmet therapeutic needs, in particular rare disease populations. I will argue that open scienc epolicies can better serve these stakeholders adn innocative intellectual policies can help develop a more equitable drug discovery process which benefits those in need, not just shareholders.

Data & Sovereignty: Resisting Colonial Logics for Racial Justice,"This event was co-supported by the McMaster Institute for Health Equity, the McMaster Indigenous Research Institute, and the Lewis and Ruth Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship. Video is available here.

Recent attentions to the collection, use, dissemination, ownership, and impacts of demographic data have convened several historical contradictions, resurfacing the contours of the false promise of equity from quantitative data collection. COVID-19 has positioned a number of initiatives that claim to address injustice and inequities in health or elsewhere though data collection often without the needs of those mined for data at the centre of these conversations. Regularly, these data are on or about Black, First Nations, Métis, Inuit, Latinx, Asian, South Asian, Caribbean, and other non-white groups, people living with mental health issues, disabilities, those who are houseless or underhoused, low-income, people living with substance use needs, and 2SLGBTQ+ populations while also collecting information on gender. These initiatives that collect and do not deliver have not gone uncontested.

"“Glitch: Disability, Feminism, Technology”","Abstract: In the TV show The Good Place (2016-2020), each heavenly neighborhood is run by a “Janet,” a feminized personal assistant with access to all the information in the universe. In season 2, Janet glitches, causing earthquakes to rock the world and large swaths of the neighbourhood to disappear. Starting from the representation of glitching robots on-screen before moving to technologies, bodies, and communities off-screen, this presentation will explore the history of “glitch feminism” and then turn to glitch as intimacy, interdependence, and Mad/crip/queer community, glitch understood through the physiology of pain in relation to technology, and glitch as a reorientation towards crip time.

Glitch: A surge of current or a spurious electrical signal… a sudden short-lived irregularity in behaviour… a hitch or snag; a malfunction (OED).

As Jerreat-Poole writes, “Glitch resonates with me as a Mad/disabled person and scholar. We have glitchy brains and glitchy bodies that don’t always do what we ask of them or what society demands of them. We have twinges and twitches and tics, both visible and invisible. We have our behaviour read as irregular or strange (Janet’s wild laughter, her hair in disarray). A glitch can be a mistake, a pause, a redirection, a new field of possibility. Glitches, embodied and/or technical, can disrupt the smooth narrative of neoliberal progress and efficiency, opening up opportunities to imagine and construct digital communities that are sick, crip, Mad, disabled, neurodivergent, feminist, and queer.”

Speaker Bio: Adan (they/them) is a mad/crip/queer scholar and white settler living on treaty territory belonging to Six Nations of the Grand River and the traditional home of the Neutral, Anishinaabe, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Adan is an Assistant Professor at the University of Waterloo in the Department of Communication Arts. They work at the intersection of disability studies and digital media. Their current research explores how disabled queer and trans feminists create, advocate, and care for each other through and with digital technology, and how we can design, hack, mod, and build more ethical technologies, societies, and futures. Adan is also a creative writer and the author of the queer YA novels The Girl of Hawthorn and Glass and The Boi of Feather and Steel (Dundurn Press).",January 2023,https://scds.github.io/ds-bytes/Glitch.html,,Disability; Digital Humanities,Research Series; DS Bytes

“The Value of Visuals in Science Communication”,"Abstract: Science research relies on data to describe theories and stories, but communicating the complex, sophisticated, or sometimes esoteric information and relationships within these data is limited. Visual storytelling is becoming increasingly important in a data-driven world: from data visualizations to diagrammatic illustrations, telling science stories requires a visual component. The reasons for this lie in the way we process information.

This talk will introduce the basics of visual perception, it’s benefit to science communication efforts, and how anyone can manipulate design theory to create visuals (of whatever skill level) to tell impactful, effective, and ultimately better science stories.

Speaker Bio: Mark (he/him) is a scientific graphics journalist and visual communicator, working at the intersection of art and science to translate scientific concepts into impactful visuals. With two Master of Science degrees (one in Geochemistry/Astrobiology, another in Biomedical Communications), his work and past experience as a researcher has led him to champion the values of visual storytelling when communicating complex and sophisticated ideas, especially in science. Mark is based in Toronto, Canada and yearns to make science more accessible to everyone, with all forms of visual media.

“How to Lie with Visualization”,"Abstract: In 1996, two researchers at IBM, Bernice Rogowitz and Lloyd Treinish, published an important article titled “How Not to Lie with Visualization.” In it, they outlined a rule-based approach to visualization that would, they argued, help users navigate the increasingly complex space of data design. “The great flexibility of visualization,” Rogowitz and Treinish wrote, “can open a Pandora’s box of problems for the user and easily give rise to visual representations that do not adequately reveal the structure in the data or that introduce misleading visual artifacts.” Since the article’s publication, visualization systems have become both more ubiquitous and more complex, and rules-based approaches have hardly reduced the proliferation of deceptive graphics. In this talk and hands-on workshop, we will pry open the Pandora’s box that Rogowitz and Treinish describe! With a nod to Darrell Huff’s 1954 classic “How to Lie with Statistics,” we will examine range of visualization techniques and methods that are frequently used to lie, deceive, and manipulate – as well as a set of design criteria that can be used to counteract graphical deception.

Thematically, the talk will explore the emergence of data-driven media, the various ways that misleading and deceptive graphics are produced and disseminated, and the relationship between authority, trust, accuracy, persuasion, and literacy.

Speaker Bio: Dr. Gabby Resch is an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Business and Information Technology at Ontario Tech. His research explores new methods for making sense of data as it moves between physical and digital worlds. At the moment, he is engaged in three collaborative SSHRC and CIHR-funded research projects that explore geospatial visualization in the context of migration-related policy; scrolling interactives for medical knowledge translation; and immersive augmented and virtual reality medical training environments. Prior to joining Ontario Tech, he was a postdoctoral fellow with the Synaesthetic Media Lab at Toronto Metropolitan University, where he carried out research on virtual reality games designed to enhance spatial cognition, AR and VR environments for motor learning, and immersive media for medicine.

Dr. Resch received his PhD from the University of Toronto, where his research examined tangible and embodied approaches to data visualization. For a number of years, he has developed and taught innovative visualization and interaction design courses at the U of T, TMU, and Ontario Tech that provide hands-on opportunities for students to learn data design concepts. He also has extensive experience collaborating with various institutional partners, including Autodesk Research, the Ontario Science Centre, the Royal Ontario Museum, and the Art Gallery of Ontario.

“E.Q. vs. I.Q.: Testing Gendered Artificial Intelligence in Apple’s Siri”,"Abstract: The Turing Test—a thought experiment by mathematician Alan Turing in which a human and a computer try to convince an interrogator that they are human—is actually based on another thought experiment by Turing: the Imitation Game—in which a man and woman try to convince an interrogator that they are a woman. In other words, a theoretical test by which we measure human-like performance was inspired by a test of gendered performance.

Today, descriptions of high IQ are attributed to machines capable of advanced decision making, including in machine learning. Meanwhile, AI designed to provide EQ-heavy labour in care, customer service, and comfort are predominantly female presenting.

In this talk, Fan will explore how the gendering of AI assistants is just a new method in a long history of abstracting women and their bodies into labouring machines, in effect nullifying the need to ask the Turing Test question of “human or machine.” Instead, AI assistants play a modified Imitation Game, trying to trick users into accepting machine as woman. By exploring industry designers’ research findings, Fan will confront the argument that “women’s voices tend to be better received by consumers, and that from an early age we prefer listening to female voices” (Tambini 2022). Performing tests on Apple’s AI assistant Siri, she will argue that when assessing such AI for human-like performance, designers are not looking for intelligence, but rather, for efficacy to get the job done—content production, menial task completion, and capital transactions—with a smile.

Speaker Bio: Lai-Tze Fan is the Director of the forthcoming research-creation-focused Unseen-AI Lab, and an Assistant Professor of Sociology & Legal Studies and English Literature at the University of Waterloo, Canada. Her work focuses systemic inequalities in technological design and labour, methods of digital storytelling, research-creation, and critical making, and media theory and infrastructure.

Fan serves as an Editor and the Director of Communications of electronic book review and an Editor of the digital review. She is Co-Editor of the collection Post-Digital: Dialogues and Debates from electronic book review (Bloomsbury 2020), and is the Editor of special journal issues on “Canadian Digital Poetics” and “Critical Making, Critical Design.” The latter issue received the Electronic Literature Organization’s 2022 N.

Science Communication and Digital Activism: Towards more meaningful science communication with the benefit of digital scholarship,"How can scholars best communicate scientific analyses and results? How can we engage wider audiences in scientific research?

In this panel, three work-in-progress papers address these questions with a shared answer: digital tools. Through case studies of their own research, emerging scholars will explore the benefits of digital scholarship in science communication and discuss the importance of employing reflexive, inclusive, and interactive approaches.

The three projects discussed here highlight the diverse forms that digital scholarship and science communication can take. Cameron Anderson presents an interactive app that allows people to listen to scientific analysis of musical research. Duygu Ertemin introduces an interactive digital exhibit and StoryMap on prehistoric periods; her novel approach to analyzing archaeological materials enables diverse audiences to interact with the exhibition by pinning comments and sharing their own thoughts and stories.

"Content Creators, Digital Labour, and Online Identities: A SCDS Graduate Resident Panel","What role do social media platforms play in forming and negotiating digital labour? How do platforms frame online selves and lives as intelligible or otherwise?

Looking Back to Go Forward: Histories of Oppositional Feminist Politics and the Internet,"Recent feminist media studies scholarship has attended to the ways in which feminism’s current popularity is intertwined with the logics of digital media platforms and neoliberal capitalism. But, has it always been? And, does it have to be? This work-in-progress talk by special guest Professor Jessalynn Keller (Communication, Media, and Film, University of Calgary) considers the possibilities for oppositional feminist politics online across both contemporary and historical contexts.

Beginning with the recent case study of #WitchTheVote (based on a paper co-written with Alora Paulsen Mulvey), Professor Keller traces how some feminist Internet users are de-centering economies of visibility, large audiences, and easily consumable content through their use of nostalgic Internet practices. Keller puts this example in conversation with a historical case study from the early 2000s, brownfemipower’s blog. She considers this influential blog as emblematic of an intersectional feminist blogging community that actively critiqued the relationship between feminism, digital media, celebrity, and whiteness in the early days of web 2.0.

Taken together, these case studies highlight the need for further historical analysis of the feminist Internet, while illuminating how Internet practices have been at the crux of tensions and reworkings of feminisms for over two decades.",May 2022,https://scds.github.io/2022-grevents/keller.html,,DH; Digital Humanities,Graduate Colloquium
Pre-Processing Digitized Texts,"We underestimate our abilities to make sense of orthographic errors and alternative spellings like thcn or shew. Machines are less capable of making these inferences, meaning that OCR text output must often be corrected to render it legible to computational methods.

Named Entity Recognition,"Names - of people or places, for instance - are a common feature of interest when working with texts at scale. We can use a search function to locate occurrences of names that we are expecting to find, such as “Frederick Douglass” in issues of The North Star, but how do we go about searching for all names in the text - even those we do not know to look for?

The natural language processing technique of named entity recognition (NER) identifies words - or tokens - that may be names, places, or organizations within unstructured text. Some NER tools will also identify tokens that may represent dates, currency and so on. It can support exploratory data analysis, highlighting entities for further investigation through close reading or produce a list of entities that can then be counted and compared.

In this workshop, we will explore how NER works and apply it to a text corpus using a Python library named SpaCy.",2022,https://scds.github.io/text-analysis-2/,Python,textual analysis,NA/ Asynchronous module created for Alex Klein
